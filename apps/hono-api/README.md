# Supametrics Internal API ðŸš€

## Overview

This project is a high-performance backend API built with Hono and TypeScript, designed to provide comprehensive analytics, user, team, and project management. It leverages Drizzle ORM for type-safe interaction with a PostgreSQL database (Neon) and utilizes Redis for robust caching and rate limiting, ensuring efficient and scalable operations.

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication via email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub) with robust JWT-based session management, refresh tokens, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **User & Profile Management**: APIs for creating, managing, and updating user profiles, including managing subscription types, account status (active, suspended, read-only), and email verification.
- **Team Management**: Functionality to create and manage teams, including inviting members with specific roles (owner, member, viewer). Supports creating team-owned projects.
- **Project Management**: Comprehensive APIs for creating, listing, updating, and deleting projects, supporting both personal and team-based ownership. Projects can have defined types (web, mobile, backend).
- **API Key Management**: Secure generation, rotation, and revocation of API keys (public and secret) for each project to control external access to analytics data.
- **Real-time Analytics Collection**: Capture and aggregate various analytics events such as page views, visitor IDs, UTM parameters, browser/OS/device information, and event-specific data (e.g., `cta_clicked`).
- **Data Reporting**: Generate and retrieve custom reports based on collected analytics data for projects.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements Redis-backed rate limiting to protect API endpoints from abuse and ensure service stability for different routes.
- **Scalable Data Storage**: Utilizes a PostgreSQL database (Neon Serverless) for reliable and scalable data persistence, managed through Drizzle ORM.
- **Efficient Caching**: Integrates Redis for high-speed data caching and transient storage for sessions and rate limiting.
- **Flexible Access Control**: Supports distinct roles for team members (owner, member, viewer) and project members (admin, editor, viewer), allowing granular permissions.

| `REFRESH_SECRET`       | `your-refresh-secret`                           | Secret key for signing JWT refresh tokens.                                                         |

### Database Migrations (Drizzle ORM)

After setting `DATABASE_URL`, ensure your database schema is up-to-date:

1.  **Generate Migration**:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
    ```
2.  **Apply Migration**: (Requires a separate script to run the migration)
    - _Note_: The codebase implies migrations are handled via `drizzle-kit`, but an explicit migration script (e.g., `drizzle-kit push:pg`) is not shown. You might need to set one up or use a `drizzle-kit push:pg` command for direct schema synchronization if no migration files are manually applied.

### Local Development

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This command uses `tsx` to watch for changes and restart the server automatically. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3004`.

### Production Build

1.  **Build Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.
2.  **Start Production Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This command runs the compiled application. The API will be available on the port configured in your environment variables (default: `3004`).

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using the documented endpoints. The base URL for all API endpoints is `http://localhost:3004/api/v1` (or your deployed domain).

Detailed API endpoints, request/response structures, and error codes are provided in the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) section of the main README. Authentication typically involves session cookies/tokens, which are handled by the `better-auth` library. For integrating analytics into your applications, use the generated project API keys for secure data submission.

## API Documentation

The existing `README.md` provides a comprehensive guide to all available API endpoints, including `GET /health`, `POST /auth/*` (for sign-up, sign-in, OAuth), `GET /overview`, `POST /projects/new`, `GET /projects`, `POST /projects/:id/rotate-key`, `DELETE /projects/:id`, `GET /projects/:id`, `POST /projects/:id/invite`, `PATCH /projects/:id/role`, `PATCH /projects/:id`, `GET /projects/:id/members`, `DELETE /projects/:id/leave`, `GET /:id/analytics`, `GET /:id/analytics/:eventName`, `GET /:id/reports`, `GET /teams`, and `POST /teams`. Please refer to the detailed descriptions above for specific request parameters, example responses, and error conditions for each endpoint.
